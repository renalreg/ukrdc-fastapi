    This function returns a decorator that modifies a function so it is periodically re-executed after its first call.

    The function it decorates should accept no arguments and return nothing. If necessary, this can be accomplished
    by using `functools.partial` or otherwise wrapping the target function prior to decoration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seconds: float
        The number of seconds to wait between repeated calls
    wait_first: bool (default False)
        If True, the function will wait for a single period before the first call
    logger: Optional[logging.Logger] (default None)
        The logger to use to log any exceptions raised by calls to the decorated function.
        If not provided, exceptions will not be logged by this function (though they may be handled by the event loop).
    raise_exceptions: bool (default False)
        If True, errors raised by the decorated function will be raised to the event loop's exception handler.
        Note that if an error is raised, the repeated execution will stop.
        Otherwise, exceptions are just logged and the execution continues to repeat.
        See https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.set_exception_handler for more info.
    max_repetitions: Optional[int] (default None)
        The maximum number of times to call the repeated function. If `None`, the function is repeated forever.
